# Accio: RAG-enhanced News (Frontend)

The prototype demonstrates how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance news by incorporating additional content from a news archive. The aim is to better address the questions and needs of different user personas, providing more comprehensive and contextual information.

The application was created for the [AI for Media Hackathon 2024](https://aiformedia.network/apply-for-our-generative-ai-hackathon/), hosted by Bayerischer Rundfunk, pub and Microsoft.

The frontend for Accio was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Fluent UI Starter](https://github.com/siminture/fluentui-starter).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://...`

4. Build the website `yarn build`

The project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) to run locally.
